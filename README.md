We created an app that would allow users to search the current data base or pet profiles. Pet owners will be able to create a profile (cats and dogs) to make play dates with other pets in the area by completing the survey that will be added to the database, one can uploading pictures, create a biography of your pet to include his or her temperament to ensure each pet will play well with one another.


In the future we would like to include a favorites button where each party could include how well their interaction with the family and pet during that day occurred. We would also like to include a sort tab of breed of dogs and cats. And finally, an informational page of the proper care of both dogs and cats.
